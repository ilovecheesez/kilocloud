 * source, so a layout cannot call i18n. The widget families read their copy
 * from the timeline props, but the Live Activity cannot: the notifications
 * Worker pushes the same raw content state and knows no locale, so a
 * background push would draw English on a localized device. The copy is
 * therefore baked into the layout source at registration, the same boundary
 * `withWidgetLogo` uses for the app-group path of the mark.

/**
 * Every layout string in the active language, plus the language tag itself.
 *
 * The tag is not copy: the widget process takes its locale from the device
 * language, so a user who overrides the app language would otherwise read
 * translated labels beside a relative wait ("28 min") formatted in the device
 * language. The layouts feed the tag to SwiftUI's `locale` environment value
 * so the whole surface speaks one language.
 *
 * The tag is the underscore form, because `@expo/ui`'s `locale` modifier
 * applies the value only when `Locale.availableIdentifiers` contains it, and
 * that list spells a script or region subtag with an underscore. `zh-Hans`,
 * `zh-Hant` and `pt-BR` failed the check and silently left the wait in the
 * device language, which is the one thing this tag exists to prevent. A
 * numbering-system extension (`ar-u-nu-latn`) fails the same check, so the
 * counts stay in Western digits beside an Arabic-Indic wait; formatting the
 * wait in JS instead would freeze it, because a pushed content state carries
 * only the timestamp.
 *
 * The slot names are the layouts' own field names, and the status slots match
 * `GlanceableAgentsSnapshot['status']` so a layout can index this by status.
