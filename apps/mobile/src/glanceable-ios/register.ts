 * expo-widgets attaches its native `NotificationCenter` observer when the first
 * JS listener subscribes and detaches it when the last one leaves
 * (`WidgetsModule.OnStartObserving`), so the handle is held in module scope
 * rather than dropped at the call site.
 *
 * The Lock Screen card and its Apple Watch mirror report the same `approve`
 * target, so a second listener for that target would run two answer flows for
 * one press; `handleGlanceableInteraction` owns both targets alone. It answers
 * through the recorded ask (`runGlanceableApprove`), which is also what gates
 * the control (`canApprove`), so the press and the button can never disagree.
