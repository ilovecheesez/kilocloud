 * The widget's in-place Approve and the headless tRPC work behind it. The
 * Android widget host launches a headless JS task for a custom `clickAction`
 * (`register.ts`), so nothing here may touch React, a query client, or a toast:
 * the widget's own reserved line is the only feedback surface. New agent is not
 * an in-place action: it needs the composer, so both platforms open the app on
 * the new-session screen instead.
 *
 * The scope (personal vs organization) comes from SecureStore, exactly as
 * `components/agents/mobile-session-manager.ts` picks org-scoped procedures
 * from the selected organization. `expo-secure-store` exists on both iOS and
 * Android, so neither platform lacks the capability and no per-platform storage
 * branch is kept: every read goes through `readStoredValue`, the app's one
 * cross-platform entry point, the same one `lib/glanceable/scope` reads.
 * `trpcClient` reads the stored token headlessly through
 * `getAuthTokenForRequest`, so a task with no Activity can authenticate.
