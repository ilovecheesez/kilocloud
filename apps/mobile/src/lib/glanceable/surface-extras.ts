/**
 * Per-surface values the versioned glanceable snapshot must never carry.
 *
 * The snapshot contract is privacy-minimal — it forbids a session title
 * (`packages/app-shared/src/glanceable-agents-snapshot.ts`, asserted in its
 * test) — so the newest session's title and the in-flight action feedback live
 * beside the snapshot instead of inside it. A module-level value rather than a
 * new `GlanceableSink` argument, so the sink interface stays unchanged and
 * every platform surface reads the same value.
 *
 * The widget redraws (a placed-widget task) and the publisher both run in this
 * process, so the value set on the last tray update is the one the next
 * headless render reads. It is never persisted: a fresh process renders the
 * snapshot's counts without the title until the next tray update.
