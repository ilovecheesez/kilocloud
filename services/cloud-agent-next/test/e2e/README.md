# cloud-agent-next local E2E harness

Drives the real `pnpm dev:start cloud-agent` stack end-to-end — Worker,
Durable Object, Sandbox container, wrapper, and **real kilo** inside the
sandbox. Only LLM inference is deterministic: selecting
`kilo/fake-deterministic` makes the local Next.js gateway proxy kilo's
OpenRouter-shaped calls to `test/e2e/fake-llm-server.ts`.

Not wired into `pnpm test` / CI — this is for local confidence during the
cloud-agent-next refactor.

## One-time setup

1. Copy `.dev.vars.example` → `.dev.vars` and fill in local values.
   Leave `KILO_OPENROUTER_BASE` pointed at local Next.js (`@url nextjs/api`).
   Control-plane scenarios need no extra enrollment: interactive
   `cloud-agent-web` creates always route to the control plane.
   The worktree-creating scenarios (`worktree-chat`, `worktree-multi-chat`,
   `long-conversation`, `leave-and-return`, `large-stream`, `concurrent-chats`,
   `interrupt-then-continue`, `question-idle-resume`, and the five `sandboxFaults`
   scenarios) additionally
   require `WORKTREE_CREATION_ENABLED_IDS`; use the seeded enrolled user
   (`E2E_USER_EMAIL`) rather than a fresh per-run user.
   Both accept comma-separated user or org IDs or `*`. Production defaults to empty/off;
   wrangler `dev` and `.dev.vars.example` default to `*`.
   Ordinary control-plane scenarios do not require `WORKTREE_CREATION_ENABLED_IDS`.
   These are Worker settings read by `auth.ts` from this service's `.dev.vars`,
   not driver environment overrides: prefixing the driver command with either
   flag does not configure the Worker. The unannotated template entries pass
   through matching root `.env.local` values during `pnpm dev:env`. Configure
   the Worker before starting it, or restart it after changing these values.
2. Ensure local Postgres is up and root `.env.local` defines `POSTGRES_URL`
   (or export `DATABASE_URL`) — the driver inserts a test user row via
   `@kilocode/db`.
3. Start the stack. The `cloud-agent` group already includes `fake-llm`:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev:start cloud-agent
   ```

   Selecting `kilo/fake-deterministic` is enough to hit fake-llm through
   Next.js. A real-model session (`kilo-auto/efficient`, etc.) uses the same
   Worker URL and does not need a restart.

## Credential containment

Control-plane sessions (`workspace_*`) respect `CREDENTIAL_CONTAINMENT_ENABLED`.
Only the literal `false` disables containment; local dev defaults to `false`.
The choice is persisted when a worktree is created and inherited by sibling chats.
Changing the environment does not switch an existing worktree or running sandbox
between contained and direct credentials.

When enabled, Cloudflare uses contained sandbox classes and the existing credential
broker; Vercel uses native network policies. Each worktree has stable credential
aliases shared by its registered Kilo roots, while different worktrees have
separate Kilo authentication contexts. Containment failures never fall back to
raw credentials. When disabled, authorized Kilo and repository credentials are
provided directly to the sandbox without alias redemption or credential injection.
Control-plane ownership, attachment scope, terminal authorization, and billing
checks still apply; direct API credentials retain their underlying access scope.
Expired direct-credential terminal leases require a session reattachment rather
than renewing only the server-side grant.

Cloudflare's native outbound handler intercepts ports 80 and 443. With containment
enabled, local targets such as `http://host.docker.internal:<offset-port>` can
bypass interception and reject aliases with HTTP 401. Contained E2E runs therefore
need sandbox-facing endpoints that traverse the native handler, plus the running
`cloudflare-git-token-service` and its capability-encryption configuration. The
local-dev direct-credential mode supports the generated high-port HTTP endpoints.

For new legacy sessions (`agent_*`), `CREDENTIAL_CONTAINMENT_ENABLED` controls
GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Kilo credential containment together. Containment
is enabled unless this variable is set to `false`. Local `dev` defaults to
`false`; set `CREDENTIAL_CONTAINMENT_ENABLED=true` in `.dev.vars` when using
proxy-compatible upstreams. Devcontainer support is retired; existing sessions
can be stopped or deleted but cannot start or resume.

Legacy containment flags are persisted at session creation, so changing the
variable affects new legacy sessions, not existing ones.

## Running

### Native supervision acceptance fixtures

With the deterministic model selected, send a native `/goal` command whose objective
is one of the following. Use a fresh alphanumeric/hyphen/underscore tag for every run.

| Objective | Native workload after the initial execution closes |
|---|---|
| `__fake__:supervision:<tag>:progress:660` | Runs three 220-second native tools, emits progress between them, then reports the goal complete after 11 minutes. Model requests remain shorter than the gateway's ten-minute limit. |
| `__fake__:supervision:<tag>:stuck:1800` | Holds the model response without output for up to 30 minutes. The wrapper's production 20-minute no-progress deadline should cancel it first. |
| `__fake__:supervision:<tag>:silent:300` | Runs a silent five-minute `bash` sleep with a 330-second native timeout, then reports the goal complete. |

The first execution runs one harmless bootstrap command and finishes its assistant
reply. The fixture begins its workload only after a later native user message appears
after that reply, so the initial `/goal` instruction cannot substitute for autonomous
continuation. The fake shares the ordinary Node/Worker implementation; it adds no
production goal tracking. Stream timers are released on model-request cancellation.
Silent tools are limited to 540 seconds because Kilo 7.8.1 caps `bash` at ten minutes.

These directives provide workloads, not acceptance verdicts. Capture the first
Cloud message's terminal outcome before evaluating the autonomous interval. Prove
the built wrapper hash, allocation/container identity, active heartbeats and lease
renewal through the interval; after completion or timeout, observe the unchanged
ten-minute idle policy. For the stalled case, check the retained/displayed
`no_progress` reason and recovery with a fresh message in the same chat.

Fast native fixture checks use one- to three-second workloads and an explicit abort for the
stall. They prove the fixture's continuation and cleanup contracts, not production
timer or sandbox acceptance:

```bash
cd services/cloud-agent-next/wrapper
KILO_781_BINARY=/path/to/isolated/kilo-7.8.1 bun test --max-concurrency=1 src/control-plane/kilo-supervision-fixture.real.test.ts
```

The local production-timer driver discovers this worktree's ports, uses the seeded
GitHub-enabled account, checks Kilo 7.8.1 and the running wrapper hash, and records
native continuation, unchanged Cloud outcomes, allocation activity and physical
idle shutdown. It leaves the stopped chat available for browser/recovery checks:

```bash
E2E_WRAPPER_SHA256=<sha256-of-reviewed-minified-control-plane-bundle> \
  pnpm exec tsx services/cloud-agent-next/test/e2e/supervision-local.ts \
  progress dev/logs/supervision-acceptance/progress-unique-run
```

Use `stuck` or `silent` for the other cases. Provide a new evidence directory for
each run. Its local creation credential lasts four hours so a later recovery check
does not inherit the ordinary driver token's one-hour expiry. These checks take
roughly 21, 30 and 15 minutes respectively and retain
the production timers. Freeze source until all timing cases finish.

> **Non-zero port offset:** except for `multichat-real.ts` and `supervision-local.ts`, the drivers below use
> the default ports (`8794`/`8811`), which only match a zero-offset session. For any other
> session, first read the offset from `pnpm dev:status --json`
> (`portOffset` field), then prefix every driver invocation with
> `WORKER_URL=http://localhost:<8794 + portOffset>` and
> `FAKE_LLM_URL=http://localhost:<8811 + portOffset>`. Without these the
> driver silently hits the wrong Worker/fake-LLM and every scenario fails
> at connection. See the env-var table below for the full list.

Real-model multichat acceptance (`kilo-auto/efficient`):

```bash
pnpm exec tsx services/cloud-agent-next/test/e2e/multichat-real.ts \
  --auth /path/to/private-auth.json \
  --out dev/logs/multichat-new-run \
  --rounds 3
```

This driver discovers the existing local stack's ports and requires an already
funded test user enrolled for control-plane and worktree creation. Pass credentials
only through an owned mode-600 auth file, never as a command-line token. The output
directory must not already exist. Bootstrap is API-assisted; sibling creation,
sends, and Stop use the real web endpoints. Three chats exercise repeated shared
file writes/reads, native tool overlap, Stop isolation, and post-Stop follow-ups.
Private reports and transcripts are retained; chats and sandboxes are not deleted
automatically. See the known CLI 7.4.20 limitation under Troubleshooting.

Official SDK basic-chat acceptance (pinned `@kilocode/sdk/v2` `7.8.1`):

```bash
pnpm --filter cloud-agent-next exec tsx test/e2e/sdk-basic-chat.ts
```

This uses a funded ephemeral local user and sends only `Authorization: Bearer ...`
to `/kilo`; prompt mutations therefore pass through real public balance
validation rather than the legacy lifecycle driver's tRPC bypass header. Because
`client.session.create()` is deliberately unsupported by the basic facade, the
driver first materializes one owned root through the existing lifecycle setup,
then proves SDK attach/chat behavior: warm and cold projected reads, cold event
wake-up plus `promptAsync()`, intentional `prompt()` rejection, active `abort()`,
stable warm/cold message pagination, and selector rejection without transcript mutation.
It stops owned sandbox families and releases any fake-LLM gate in cleanup.

Focused lifecycle scenario:

```bash
tsx services/cloud-agent-next/test/e2e/run.ts [--api=unified|legacy] [--timeout-ms=<n>] <lifecycle> <conversation>
```

`--timeout-ms=<n>` sets one finite, positive overall deadline for the selected
scenario. It is accepted for exactly the names in the shared registry
(`SHARED_SCENARIOS`); every runnable scenario is a shared definition now. The
flag is rejected for any other name; it is not a per-operation timeout.

Every scenario is now a shared definition. The long scenarios (`worktree-chat`,
`worktree-multi-chat`, `long-conversation`, `leave-and-return`, `large-stream`,
`concurrent-chats`, `question-idle-resume`) and the `sandboxFaults` scenarios
(`external-kill`, `kill-mid-flight`, `wrapper-freeze-settled-reap`,
`wrapper-freeze-inflight-reap`, `control-socket-recycle-boot`) are all in the
registry, so the matrix runs them:
the worktree flows need an enrolled driver user, and the fault flows stop or
freeze a real container, so they run last. They stay name-runnable
(`run.ts <name> _`) for focused runs; the matrix marks the capability-gated
ones `unsupported`. Long scenarios take
6–30 minutes and require the funded seeded user
(`E2E_USER_EMAIL=evgeny@kilocode.ai`), the offset-prefixed `WORKER_URL` and
`FAKE_LLM_URL`, and `E2E_MODEL=kilo/fake-deterministic`; the new scenarios reject
other models. They use the unified API and require control-plane/worktree
enrollment.

Matrix (runs the default regression suite):

```bash
pnpm --filter cloud-agent-next run e2e:local
pnpm --filter cloud-agent-next exec tsx test/e2e/matrix.ts --profile local --parallel 2
```

`matrix.ts` is the one matrix runner for every profile (see "The matrix runner"
below): one `run.ts` child per scenario under one pool, each with its own
`E2E_FAKE_SCOPE`. On the local profiles the default pool is the number of
sandboxes the Docker VM holds beside the stack (about 1.5 GiB each), at most 4;
`--parallel` or `E2E_PARALLEL` overrides it and warns when it exceeds that
number. Pass the offset-prefixed `WORKER_URL`, `FAKE_LLM_URL`, and
`KILO_SESSION_INGEST_URL`, plus `E2E_CONTROL_PLANE_V2=1` and `E2E_USER_EMAIL`
when the matrix includes worktree scenarios. The local dev container caps in
`wrangler.jsonc` (6 for the small classes the matrix boots) are sized for a
12 GiB Docker VM; restart `cloud-agent-next` after changing them.

The matrix starts with `cold-hot`, which pays one cold sandbox boot and then
runs several hot same-session turns.

### Teardown

The shared gate (`runSharedScenario`) owns teardown for every profile, so
`run.ts`, the matrix and every child get the same cleanup. After a scenario,
including a failed one, the gate:

1. records every session the scenario's creates report, with its Kilo session id;
2. interrupts, then deletes them, newest first (idempotent: the scenarios also
   clean up in their own `finally`);
3. on the `local` profile, stops each sandbox those sessions provably owned,
   primary and `-proxy` together. The dev config sets
   `PER_SESSION_SANDBOX_ORG_IDS` to `*`, so every session, for any user, has its
   own `ses-…` sandbox derived from its unique session id, and the proxy is named
   after it. Once the sessions are deleted nothing can address that sandbox
   again. (A proxy is only reused when the same sandbox gets a replacement
   primary during a test; deleting it then is a separate proxy-chaos case.)

Step 3 exists because a deleted session only releases its route; the sandbox
otherwise lives until the 10-minute idle stop, and a few dozen scenarios exhaust
the Docker VM. Ownership is proven through the live Kilo root and the
exclusivity check, so a sandbox that still hosts another worktree, or a session
that recorded no Kilo session id, is left running and reported
(`sandbox reclaim: ...`), never killed. The `local-http` and `deployed` profiles
have no Docker access and stop at step 2. A child killed by its watchdog skips
its own teardown; after a local run the matrix prints
`Sandboxes still running from this run: <n>` and, when primaries are gone but
their proxies remain, `Orphan sandbox proxies running: <n>`. It never removes
either: a proxy can belong to a test that is still running, or to another
worktree's stack on the same Docker daemon.

Tracking requires a returned session ID. If unified `start` allocates ownership
but fails before returning that ID, the driver cannot automatically cancel it.
Use the failed run's user ID and ownership logs to identify and interrupt only
those sessions; do not infer ownership from container creation time.

Per-run overrides via env vars. Defaults assume a zero-offset session;
for any other offset, compute the real ports from `pnpm dev:status --json`
(worker = `8794 + portOffset`, fake-LLM = `8811 + portOffset`):

| Var | Default |
|---|---|
| `WORKER_URL` | `http://localhost:8794` |
| `FAKE_LLM_URL` | `http://localhost:8811` (host-side view) |
| `E2E_GIT_URL` | `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git` |
| `E2E_GITHUB_REPO` | unset. When set (`owner/repo`), start uses GitHub-app clone instead of `gitUrl`. Pair with `E2E_USER_EMAIL` for the seeded installation. |
| `E2E_USER_EMAIL` | unset (ephemeral `usr_e2e_*`). Set to the cloud-worktree-setup email to reuse that user and its GitHub integration. |
| `E2E_BRANCH` | unset. Optional checkout ref (`upstreamBranch` / `repository.branch`). |
| `E2E_MODEL` | `kilo/fake-deterministic` (the only model the fake serves) |
| `E2E_CONTROL_PLANE_V2` | unset. Set to `1` to advertise the new-plane (`workspace_*`) capability so the C1-gated scenarios run instead of reporting `unsupported`. It does not replace the per-scenario `controlPlaneRuntime` proof that the container runs the new-plane wrapper, so it cannot be used to false-pass against the legacy plane. |
| `E2E_FAKE_SCOPE` | unset. `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}` attribution token prepended to every prompt as `__e2e_scope__:<token>`. `fetchFakeRequests` then reads `GET /test/requests?scope=<token>` instead of the global total, so a parallel shard asserts only on its own completions. The fake strips the marker before parsing the directive or echoing, so it never reaches scenario-visible content. A malformed value fails the run. |
| `E2E_INTERNAL_API_SECRET` | unset. Required in the launcher shell for the local HTTP e2e profile (`cloud-agent-next-http`): the render command writes it into the generated `.wrangler/.dev.vars` as the Worker's `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`. The shared rules (`requireE2eInternalSecret`) reject the development default, values shorter than 16 characters, and whitespace; the renderer additionally rejects values outside `[A-Za-z0-9._~-]`, because only it writes a dotenv line. Must differ from production's `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`. The local-HTTP driver resolves it like the deployed driver — the exported value or the auth file's `e2eInternalApiSecret` — so both ends must agree. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Optional direct database URL override for this harness |
| `POSTGRES_URL` | Repo database fallback loaded from root `.env.local` / `.env` |

If `DATABASE_URL` is unset, the standalone TSX driver loads root `.env.local`
and `.env`, then falls back to `@kilocode/db` `computeDatabaseUrl()`, which
uses `POSTGRES_URL` for local development.

`FAKE_LLM_URL` is how the **driver** reaches the fake server (for
`/test/release`, `/test/gate-status`, `/test/waiters`, and `/test/requests`
side channels). `KILO_OPENROUTER_BASE` stays on Next.js; the gateway routes
`fake-deterministic` to fake-llm. If you changed the fake's port (e.g.
non-zero `portOffset`), set `FAKE_LLM_URL` to the matching host-reachable
view. Next.js picks up the same offset from
`apps/web/.env.development.local`.

The local HTTP e2e profile (`cloud-agent-next-http`) also requires
`E2E_INTERNAL_API_SECRET` exported in the shell that launches it: the renderer
reads `process.env.E2E_INTERNAL_API_SECRET` and writes it into the generated
`.wrangler/.dev.vars`, which becomes the Worker's `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`. The
local-HTTP driver calls the same `bootstrapDeployedProfile()` as the deployed
profile, so it accepts the exported value or an `E2E_AUTH_FILE` whose
`e2eInternalApiSecret` field supplies it; both ends must resolve to the same
value. The value is never written into the service command string, because tmux
mirrors those into `dev/logs/*`. Do not rotate the secret by restarting the
service: `restartServiceInTmux` reuses the pane environment, and the CLI
tunnel-restart path reloads `cloud-agent-next` rather than the HTTP variant. Stop
the HTTP group and start a fresh launcher session with
`E2E_INTERNAL_API_SECRET` exported (the same value the driver uses), and never
type the secret into a logged pane command.

## Deployed profile (`E2E_PROFILE=deployed`)

The deployed profile drives a real deployed Cloudflare stack instead of the
local Docker harness. See [`deploy/README.md`](./deploy/README.md) for the full
deploy reference.

Two Workers, in deploy order:

1. `fake-llm` — Worker + `FakeLlmState` Durable Object running the
   shared `fake-llm-core.ts`; deploy first with
   `test/e2e/deploy/deploy-fake-llm.sh deploy`.
2. `cloud-agent-e2e-test` — private render of this package's Worker;
   deploy second with
   `E2E_USER_ID=<id> FAKE_LLM_BASE_URL=<base> test/e2e/deploy/deploy-e2e-worker.sh deploy`.
   Add `E2E_INTERNAL_API_SECRET=<secret>` on the first deploy or to rotate it; a
   redeploy without it keeps the deployed Worker secret.

The fake Worker's state model: one Durable Object (`new_sqlite_classes`,
migration `v1`). Open streams cannot survive Durable Object eviction, so
`gate`/`hang` directives are unsupported on the deployed profile. The
`/test/*` scenario counters persist per tag, and the persisted snapshot retains
the newest 200 tags by insertion order, evicting the oldest first — a reused
tag that is never re-inserted can be evicted and restart its counters at zero.

Two different fake URL bases — do not conflate them:

- The deploy script prints
  `FAKE_LLM_BASE_URL=https://<fake-host>/api/openrouter`. That value is for the
  e2e Worker's provider config (`KILO_OPENROUTER_BASE`); pass it to
  `deploy-e2e-worker.sh`.
- The driver's `FAKE_LLM_URL` must be the fake Worker ROOT
  `https://<fake-host>` with **no** `/api/openrouter`, because the scenarios call
  `/test/requests` (and the other `/test/*` side channels) on it. Do not reuse
  the `/api/openrouter` provider base as `FAKE_LLM_URL`.

Driver env: `E2E_PROFILE=deployed`, `WORKER_URL`,
`E2E_BACKEND_URL=https://api.kilo.ai`, `FAKE_LLM_URL`, and a user token from
either `E2E_USER_TOKEN` or `E2E_AUTH_FILE`; optional `E2E_MODEL` (default
`kilo/fake-deterministic`) and `E2E_GIT_URL`. `E2E_USER_TOKEN`, when set and
non-empty, is an ordinary personal Kilo API token presented verbatim; it needs
no separate `userId` or `email`. Otherwise `E2E_AUTH_FILE` must name a mode-600
JSON file carrying the `token` field. When neither supplies a token the run fails
and names both variables. An empty value counts as unset; a whitespace-padded
value is present but rejected, never trimmed.

The admin
bearer for every `/test/*` side channel resolves in order: `FAKE_LLM_ADMIN_TOKEN`
when it is set and non-empty, else the `fakeLlmAdminToken` field of the auth file
named by `E2E_AUTH_FILE`, else a failure naming both options. The resolved value
must be non-empty, must not have leading/trailing whitespace, must not be the
insecure development default `local-fake-llm-admin`, and is never printed. The
deployed bootstrap exports the resolved value into `FAKE_LLM_ADMIN_TOKEN` for the
run, so `releaseGate`, `fetchFakeWaiters`, `fetchFakeRequests`,
`fetchFakeScenarioStatus` and `waitForGateEngaged` authenticate with no extra
configuration; precedence is env then auth file. The deployed profile reads the
auth file at most once and only when a source needs it: never when `E2E_USER_TOKEN`
and `FAKE_LLM_ADMIN_TOKEN` are both set. The
deployed profile never reads `.dev.vars`, root env files, or Postgres, and never
mints valid authentication credentials or stream tickets.
The `auth-reject` negative probe deliberately signs one **invalid** JWT
(wrong secret); it is used only for that bad-signature probe and is never
presented as a valid credential.

The auth file, named by the optional `E2E_AUTH_FILE`, is JSON
`{ "token", "userId"?, "email"?, "fakeLlmAdminToken"? }` in a mode-600 file:
`token` is required, `userId` is optional (when present it must equal the
`kiloUserId` decoded from the token; when omitted it is derived from it), and
`email` is optional (an omitted value yields no email). The file carries the Kilo
identity and the fake-llm admin bearer as one alternative to `E2E_USER_TOKEN` and
`FAKE_LLM_ADMIN_TOKEN`. The token must be an **ordinary
personal Kilo API token** (the `generateApiToken` family), obtained from the
user's personal API key or CLI token flow.
Session/control tokens, organization tokens, and delegated/runtime tokens are
refused with a diagnostic: they take the runtime-authorization path, and
admission then fails with `Model catalog authentication unavailable`. The token
is never printed.

Exact run command, from `services/cloud-agent-next`:

```bash
E2E_PROFILE=deployed pnpm exec tsx test/e2e/run.ts cold-hot echo:hi
```

Every runnable scenario is a shared definition in `scenarios-shared*.ts`.
Capabilities a scenario declares but a profile does not provide make it
`unsupported`: the run reports `ok: false, unsupported: true` with the missing
capability names, and it never runs with the assertion dropped. `auth-reject`
requires `deployedHttpAuthBoundary`, so it is `unsupported` under the local
profile; the five `sandboxFaults` scenarios (`external-kill`, `kill-mid-flight`,
`wrapper-freeze-settled-reap`, `wrapper-freeze-inflight-reap`,
`control-socket-recycle-boot`) are `unsupported`
deployed, and `kill-mid-flight` also needs the local-only `gates` marker.
The new-plane `kilo-kill-recovery`, `wrapper-kill-recovery`, and
`kilo-hang-recovery` also declare `sandboxFaults` (so they are local-only) plus
`controlPlaneV2` + `controlPlaneRuntime`; `control-plane-callbacks` declares the
local-only `reports` (Postgres); `attachment` declares the unimplemented
`attachments`; `contained-credentials` declares `credentialContainment`, read from
the Worker `.dev.vars`. Only `cold-hot` and `unknown-model` declare no capability.
Every other scenario that runs under both declares `sessionSandbox`, which both
profiles provide; `auth-reject` and the sandbox-fault scenarios are the exceptions
named above. Container identity stays a capability-gated assertion.

Scenario matrix:

| Shared scenario | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cold-hot <directive>` | One cold turn plus `echo:hot`, `slow:3:50`, `echo:followup` hot turns on one session. Requires positive cold preparation evidence and per-message hot completion evidence, and rejects any hot-turn preparation event. For an `echo:<token>` directive it also asserts the correlated cold text: assistant messages whose `info.parentID` is the cold user message id, their `text` parts selected by `part.messageID`, latest snapshot per part id, joined equals `<token>`. Non-echo directives skip that assertion (`cold-content=skipped(not-echo:<token>)`). Default `240s` per turn. Under the local profile it also proves the cold container persists and no new container appears. |
| `unknown-model` | Starts with `kilo/does-not-exist`; requires fail-closed admission (`Selected model is not available`) with no fake chat completion dispatched. Under the local profile it also confirms on a short delay that no sandbox appeared. |
| `auth-reject _` | Starts no session. Probes the fake Worker directly over HTTPS (every request timeout-bounded): each model route with no bearer → 401; `Bearer not-a-jwt` → 401; a JWT signed with the wrong secret → 401; positive control `GET /api/openrouter/models` with the real `config.bearerToken` → 200; each `/test/*` route without the admin bearer → 401 and with it → 2xx/400/404; crossover both ways (admin bearer on a model route → 401, model token on `/test/*` → 401). It proves the public HTTP auth boundary only: no sandbox credential propagation and no session path. |
| `worktree-chat _` | Creates a worktree chat through the public tRPC surface. Requires the worktree id to correspond to the workspace identity (`workspace_<uuid>` → `worktree_<uuid>`), the session's own scope id, `parentSessionId` null and `autoCommit=false`, then a cold echo boot turn, an idempotent same-key replay (same identities, `replayed=true`), and one hot echo turn with no reported preparation, matching allocation references observed before and after the turn through the capability's bounded present-reference wait, and correlated content. The boot allocation reference is acquired **after** the boot turn completes through that bounded wait with a `240 s` budget, so the wait starts only after the boot turn has completed, not while the sandbox is still cold; the hot-turn read uses the same bounded wait (`waitForPresentAllocation`) with a `30 s` cap plus a `1 s` outer backstop slack, tolerates a transient `null` observation, and hard-fails only when no reference appears within the budget. It proves matching observed references before and after each turn, not uninterrupted presence between observations. It runs under the local Docker and deployed HTTP profiles from one definition and asserts only public-surface, per-chat outcomes. |
| `worktree-multi-chat _` | Boots a root chat, then starts a paced `slow:90:1000:32` turn and waits (budget `60 s`) until that turn is underway: correlated-part liveness for the paced message (transient and empty initialization parts permitted) plus a bounded increase in the fake's aggregate `chatCompletions` counter. The counter is **not** an authoritative paced-request signal: it is attributed to the paced request only under the documented assumption that no auxiliary/title request is in flight in that window, and it cannot distinguish the paced primary request from an auxiliary one. A content-based predicate (correlated non-empty text) was tried and reverted: the paced child's only correlated part can be the empty transient init part, and its streamed content can lag past the wait budget, so the predicate never fired even though the fake had served the request. The laziness baseline is taken only after readiness. It then creates a sibling chat while the turn is still streaming. Requires the root still `queued`/`running` immediately after the create and completing afterwards, the sibling to share one non-null `worktreeId` and `sandboxId` while keeping a distinct workspace/`ses_` identity and its own scope, `chatCompletions` unchanged over a 15 s window (lazy create) and over a same-key replay, the sibling's first turn to report its own `preparing`, and interleaved root-second and sibling-second turns. It proves the shared checkout (the root writes an uncommitted file, the sibling reads it, the root overwrites it, a fresh sibling read echoes the second nonce), sequential question ownership (asked in the root while the sibling is idle, visible only on the root's stream, only the root can answer, and a reconnect replays the still-open question with no new model request), a targeted interrupt of the sibling while the root holds a paced `slow` turn (the root stays nonterminal and then completes, the sibling's turn fails `reason=interrupted`, and the root's allocation reference is unchanged), and a targeted delete of the sibling while the root is active (the sibling's `getSession` rejects and the root accepts and completes another turn). Chat-content isolation scans each chat's streams and a fresh replay stream for the other chat's message ids and, without the `parentID` filter, the other chat's markers. Honest limit: the worktree runtime serializes streaming model turns, so the scenario does not ask a question or start a model turn in one chat while the other streams, and it does not claim concurrent streaming; isolation is per-chat control/state. No `gate`/`hang` is used. |
| `long-conversation [echo:cold]` | One cold `echo:cold` turn plus twelve hot turns (nine `echo:<token>` turns, one paced `slow:2:50` turn, and a real `file:write`/`file:read` pair). Requires the cold turn to complete with a reported preparation and its correlated content, every hot turn to complete without a reported preparation and with matching allocation references observed before and after through the bounded present-reference wait (not uninterrupted presence between observations), and each `echo:` turn's correlated content. Measured behaviour, not history restoration. |
| `leave-and-return _` | Boots, completes a boot echo turn, then leaves the session with no demand. Samples the allocation reference targeting +60 s (must still be the baseline `P1`); the baseline read is the bounded present-reference wait, so it may take up to `30 s` to obtain a present reference and its measured timestamp can be later than +60 s. Then every 15 s for up to a 15-minute budget; it fails closed while `P1` remains and if a different non-null reference appears, and stops once the reference is absent. On resume it requires a reported preparation, a different non-null reference `P2`, a completed turn with its echo marker and — from a fresh replay stream — the boot turn's replayed correlated content. It never names a stop cause: a `null` reference is reported as "the allocation disappeared while unattended", not as a release. |

Run artifact for `cold-hot`: capture the fake `/test/requests`
`chatCompletions` count before and after the run and expect **at least 4 new
completions** across the run (one cold turn plus three hot turns). Record that
delta with the scenario's
`session=workspace_<uuid>; cold=complete; cold-content="<token>"; hot=...` line
and the deployment id from `wrangler deployments list`.

### Public-surface-only evidence

The four shared scenarios above reach the Worker only through `client.ts` tRPC
helpers, WebSocket streams, the fake `/test/*` surface and the `sessionSandbox`
capability. They inspect no Docker files or processes, no worker logs and no
Postgres/`@kilocode/db`, and they call no auth helper directly. Authentication
is profile-specific: the deployed/HTTP path mints no token, while the local
Docker profile authenticates through the same local `mintApiToken` seam as every
other local scenario (`client.ts` → `auth.ts`). The acknowledged transitive
`client.ts → auth.ts → @kilocode/db` import exists, but no new scenario path
uses it.

Honest limits, recorded deliberately:

- `fetchFakeRequests` reads the global counter on a shared fake when no
  `E2E_FAKE_SCOPE` is set, so a single focused run's lazy-create evidence holds
  only while no other run is dispatching. The parallel runner sets a per-shard
  scope, which attributes only that shard's labeled requests; a request the shard
  dials without its prompt marker is unattributed. In `worktree-multi-chat`
  a bounded increase in that counter is the paced-readiness gate; it is
  **not** an authoritative paced-request signal. It is attributed to the paced
  request only under the assumption that no auxiliary/title request is in flight
  in that window, and the fake's aggregate `/test/requests` surface cannot
  distinguish the paced primary request from an auxiliary one.
- `worktree-multi-chat` paced readiness is **correlated-part liveness for the
  paced message** (transient and empty initialization parts permitted) **plus a
  bounded increase in the aggregate `chatCompletions` counter**, budget `60 s`.
  This proves the turn is live and that some request was dialed; it does not
  prove the increase was the paced primary request. A stronger content predicate
  (correlated **non-empty text**) was tried and reverted: live runs showed the
  paced child with `children=1 parts=9 correlated=2 text=1 nonEmptyText=0` (only
  the empty transient init part) while the fake had already served the paced
  request, so the predicate never fired and the counter check was never
  consulted.
- `physicalProviderRef === null` is not a release proof: a `creating` allocation
  and a local probe error also yield `null`. The leave-and-return baseline
  targets +60 s but is acquired through the bounded present-reference wait, so it
  may take up to `30 s` to obtain a present reference and its measured timestamp
  can be later than +60 s; the baseline sample plus "no demand during the
  interval" is what makes the absence meaningful, and the stop cause is never
  claimed from it. Local absence is a coarse signal.
- A missing preparation event proves the absence of *reported* preparation, not
  the absence of attachment.
- The fresh replay stream proves that the DO's persisted event log still replays
  the boot marker ("replayed transcript preservation"), not sandbox transcript
  or model-context restoration. The collector is removal-aware, so a replay that
  removes the content no longer passes.
- Chat-content isolation is a content check only: it does not prove physical
  isolation or that the two chats share one container.
- Cleanup is clean only for the returned-id path. A create that succeeds
  server-side but loses its response, or is aborted, returns no id and cannot be
  cleaned from that call; operation keys make the create idempotent for retry.

Run artifacts for the new scenarios (local Docker profile):

- `worktree-chat`: `session=workspace_<uuid>; ses=ses_...; worktreeId=worktree_<uuid> (matches workspace identity); scope=self; autoCommit=false; allocationRef=<R>; initial=<marker>; hot=no-preparing; hotAllocationRef=<R> (read); replay=idempotent`
- `worktree-multi-chat`: `root=...; sibling=...; worktree=<worktree_...>; sandboxId=<ses-...>; scope=distinct; rootNonterminalAfterSiblingCreate=true; lazyChatCompletions=<before>-><after> (unchanged over <interval>); replay=idempotent; siblingPreparing=true; interleaved=root-second+sibling-second complete; chatContentIsolation=true (no other-chat ids or markers in either chat's streams/replay)`
- `long-conversation`: `cold=prepare; hot=12/12 complete; no-preparing=true; allocationRef stable=<R> (read each turn)`
- `leave-and-return`: `session=workspace_<uuid>; providerRef=<P1>; baselineSample=<P1>@t=<ms>; absentSample=null@t=<ms>; samples=<n>:<ref>@t=<ms>|<ref>@t=<ms>|...; resumePreparing=true; replacement=<P2>!=<P1>; replayedTranscript=<bootMessageId>:<marker>; stopCause=not-read` (every poll sample is reported with its elapsed time, all measured from one interval origin)

### The matrix runner

```bash
pnpm --filter cloud-agent-next run e2e:parallel     # deployed, pool of 4 (what CI runs)
pnpm --filter cloud-agent-next run e2e:deployed     # deployed, serial
pnpm --filter cloud-agent-next run e2e:local        # local Docker
E2E_PARALLEL=all pnpm --filter cloud-agent-next run e2e:parallel
pnpm --filter cloud-agent-next exec tsx test/e2e/matrix.ts --profile local-http --parallel 2
pnpm --filter cloud-agent-next exec tsx test/e2e/matrix.ts --profile local --only cold,worktree-chat
```

`matrix.ts` runs every entry in `SHARED_SCENARIOS` under one concurrency pool,
one scenario per child process (`run.ts`), passing each scenario's
`defaultConversation` and `defaultTimeoutMs`. The profile is `--profile`, else
`E2E_PROFILE`, else `local`; `local-http` and `deployed` need no Postgres and
the deployed profile needs no local Docker daemon. The pool is `--parallel`,
else `E2E_PARALLEL` (a positive integer or `all`), else `4` on `deployed` and
the Docker-memory-derived default described above on the local profiles.
`--parallel 1` is a serial run. `--only a,b` runs just those scenarios through the
same pool and accounting. `E2E_LOCAL_HTTP=1` still selects `local-http`.

Each child gets a unique `E2E_FAKE_SCOPE`, so its completions are counted
separately on the shared fake and its `fetchFakeRequests`
"unchanged"/"increased" assertions stay meaningful while other shards dispatch.
The local profile also runs `cold-hot` once more under the legacy API. The
scenarios that stop or freeze a container run last.

Capability-gated scenarios are filtered out up front and are never spawned; the
set is derived per run from `isScenarioSupported(definition, env)`, so a declared
capability gap is a reported skip, not a failure. Local expected-unsupported is
exactly `auth-reject`. The end-of-run output is a machine-readable contract:

```
unsupported: <name>
Summary: <pass> passed, <fail> failed, <unsupported> unsupported
Wall time: <seconds>s
```

The runner asserts that every registry scenario became a job or an `unsupported`
line and that every job reported, and exits `2` otherwise. Because unsupported
scenarios are filtered before spawn, a non-zero child exit is a failure: exit `1`
if any scenario failed, else `0`. A child that exceeds its watchdog deadline (its
scenario budget plus ten minutes) is killed and reported as a failure. When
`GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` is set the runner appends its `Summary:` line to that file.

The `cloud-agent-e2e-tests` GitHub workflow
(`.github/workflows/cloud-agent-e2e-tests.yml`) is `workflow_dispatch`-only and
runs `e2e:parallel` as ONE job — no `plan`, matrix, or `aggregate` jobs — with
`E2E_PARALLEL=4`, and uploads `e2e.log`. Job failure is the runner's exit code.
The workflow keeps its workflow-level `concurrency` only. Use `run.ts <name> _`
for a focused single scenario.

The gate's session release is bounded: `interruptSession` (15 s) then
`deleteSession` (45 s), newest first. The 45 s delete bound is a CLIENT budget,
not proof the container was destroyed — a returned teardown can leave the
allocation `stopping`. Capability gaps are reported as `unsupported`, not
failures: the deployed profile marks a Docker-only flow (`sandboxFaults`,
`gates`) `unsupported` and does not spawn it.

Cold boots contend on container provisioning, so `all` maximises the chance of a
container cold-start timeout showing up as a false failure; the default trades
wall time for stability. On the deployed profile the pool size is an experiment to
recalibrate after an operator run, not a proven live-allocation bound: a
finished scenario can retain its allocation until the idle stop, so peak live
allocations can exceed the active-child count. On the local profile the gate
stops the sandboxes a finished scenario owned, so live sandboxes track the pool. The scoped counter attributes a completion only when its
prompt carries that shard's marker; a request the harness dials without the
scenario's prompt (for example a buggy lazy create) is not attributed and stays a
documented limit.

Accepted production-coupling risk (repeated from `deploy/README.md`): dedicated
Worker names keep the stack addressable separately from production; they do
**not** isolate its resources. The e2e Worker render clones the production
bindings — the production Hyperdrive/Postgres database, the `kilocode-sessions`
R2 bucket, and production service bindings — and its endpoints are public with
valid-token admission only, with no per-user isolation.

Docker scope boundary: deploying the fake Worker needs no Docker (it is a Worker
and a Durable Object, not a container image); deploying the Cloud Agent e2e
Worker still needs Docker for its sandbox container images; running the deployed
driver needs no local Docker daemon.

The deployed profile's `auth-reject` scenario is the only deployed negative
auth proof. It does not exercise a sandbox, so it cannot show that credentials
reached the fake from inside a session.

Every shared scenario runs under both profiles from one definition; each
declares its required capabilities, so the deployed profile marks a
Docker-only flow (`sandboxFaults`/`gates`) `unsupported` rather than skipping its
assertions. Long `gate`/`hang` directives remain outside the supported deployed
profile (short streams only).

The deployed profile sends `x-skip-balance-check`, so the enrolled user needs no
funding: the deterministic fake LLM performs no billable inference, and the e2e
render disables container billing. Balance admission is not part of the deployed
e2e contract.

Honest caveat: `cold-hot` proves the warm dispatch path, not physical
container identity. The absence of hot-turn preparation events is not proof that
the same container served the turns; identity stays a local-only assertion.

The five `sandboxFaults` scenarios' deployed statements are inference, not
proof: the deployed matrix was not run for this change. The single workflow job's
`timeout-minutes: 180` is an operational ceiling, not a certified or
registry-derived bound; the scenarios mix per-turn and overall budgets, so no
whole-run total is derivable. Their `sessionSandbox` capability over HTTP reports the
persisted control-plane allocation reference, so "the same container" is
allocation-reference stability, not a live runtime observation, and the HTTP
surface cannot enumerate containers.

Cleanup and retained artifacts: under the deployed profile the shared gate owns
session teardown, so scenarios that never deleted their own sessions now release
them too. Cleanup against the e2e Worker runs first — `interruptSession` (15 s
bound) then `deleteSession` (45 s bound, newest first), each attempted
independently and bounded by an abort timeout. The 45 s delete bound is a CLIENT
budget, not proof the container was destroyed: a returned teardown can still
leave the allocation `stopping`, and the abort does not roll back a committed
retirement. The public `deleteSession` does not delete live `cli_sessions_v2`
rows, so one retained row per started session survives for the enrolled user. The
user-runnable web `cliSessionsV2.delete` flow (which targets the PRODUCTION
Worker) is the later cleanup for those rows, not a fallback for failed e2e
cleanup.

Troubleshooting:

- **Token refused with a policy diagnostic** — use an ordinary personal token;
  the auth-file rule above lists the rejected families.
- **Missing user token** — set `E2E_USER_TOKEN`, or set `E2E_AUTH_FILE` to a
  mode-600 JSON file with a `token` field; the failure names both.
- **`WORKER_URL`/`FAKE_LLM_URL`/`E2E_BACKEND_URL` must be `https://`** — the
  deployed profile refuses plain HTTP.
- **Container cold-start timeout** — `cold-hot` defaults to 240s per
  turn; a first real container boot can exceed two minutes.
- **Fake Worker `/health`** — `curl https://fake-llm.engineering-e11.workers.dev/health`
  confirms the container Worker is up.

## Gateway contract

The fake gateway serves the Kilo routes used in this harness:

- `GET /api/openrouter/models` - runtime model discovery inside sandboxed kilo.
- `POST /api/openrouter/models/validate` - Worker-side fail-fast model validation.
- `POST /api/openrouter/chat/completions` - deterministic streamed completion scenarios.

### SDK coverage boundary

`sdk-basic-chat.ts` intentionally avoids timing-sensitive assertions already
covered by focused unit or Workers-runtime fixtures: multi-root mapping
ordering and zero-DO list projection, R2 replacement races, private-path
optional fixture variants, and SSE heartbeat/comment parsing. The normal acceptance
scenario asserts that blocking `prompt()` remains intentionally unsupported;
chat admission and wake-up are tested exclusively through `promptAsync()`.

## Conversation directives

A conversation directive is embedded in the user-visible prompt as
`__fake__:<scenario>[:<arg1>[:<arg2>...]]`. The fake LLM gateway parses it
from the last user message and dispatches the matching scenario. The
source of directive truth is `test/e2e/fake-llm-core.ts`, shared by the local
Node server (`fake-llm-server.ts`) and the deployed Worker + Durable Object
(`fake-llm-worker.ts`).

| Directive | Behavior |
|---|---|
| *(no `__fake__:` directive)* | Echo the last user message after stripping kilo `<environment_details>`. |
| `slow:<n>:<ms>` | `n` content chunks `<ms>` apart, then stop + `[DONE]`. Used for pacing/timing probes. |
| `realistic:<text>` | Role delta, 3 deterministic reasoning deltas, then content deltas with whitespace separators as their own deltas, then stop + [DONE] with usage; text is capped at 4000 characters and 512 pieces to emulate a real provider stream. |
| `idle` | One empty-delta chunk, then stop + `[DONE]`. |
| `hang` | Opens the SSE stream but emits nothing and never closes. Drives abort/timeout paths. |
| `first-token:<tag>[:<completion>]` | Emits one assistant content chunk (`held-first-token`) then parks the SSE stream open, so a client frozen mid-turn never receives a finish. A later request with the same tag completes normally with `<completion>` (default `done-<tag>`); the fixture can also exercise a later request with that tag. `kilo-hang-recovery` observes the first native delta, expects `agent_restarted` after the freeze, and recovers with a fresh message. |
| `error-terminal:<msg>` | HTTP 400 with OpenAI-shaped error body carrying `<msg>`. Exercises nonretryable provider-error propagation through the gateway. |
| `error:<msg>` | HTTP 402 with OpenAI-shaped error body carrying `<msg>`. The non-BYOK gateway converts this to retryable HTTP 503. |
| `gate:<tag>` | Opens the SSE stream, emits no chunks, blocks until the driver calls `POST /test/release?tag=<tag>`. On release, emits `"done"` + stop + `[DONE]`. |
| `read-then-write:<tag>:<srcPath>:<destPath>:<prefix>` | Issues a real `read` for `srcPath`, then writes `prefix` plus a newline plus the cleaned read body to `destPath`, and gates until release. The prefix may contain colons; line-number wrappers and prompt context are removed from the carried body. |
| `file:write:<tag>:<path>:<contents>` | Issues a real `write` tool call for `<path>` with `<contents>` (colons and newlines allowed in the contents), then answers `file-write:<path>` after the tool result. |
| `file:seed:<tag>:<path>:<bytes>:<nonce>` | Issues a real `write` of a deterministic `<bytes>`-byte seed fixture prefixed by `<nonce>` to `<path>`. The write tool argument carries the large payload; the read-back echo is where it is measured, so `large-stream` never substitutes assistant text. |
| `file:read:<tag>:<path>` | Issues a real `read` for `<path>` and answers `file-read:<path>` plus the normalized body; rejects a result that does not match the requested path, is an error, or is empty. |
| `question:<tag>:<text>` | Issues a real question tool call for `<text>`. The turn parks until `answerQuestion` resolves the question id; `toolResults.question` stays `0` while unanswered. |

Unknown `__fake__:<name>` directives produce HTTP 402 with
`unknown fake scenario: <name>` — easy to spot in fake-LLM logs.
A prompt with no `__fake__:` prefix echoes instead.

### Side channels

The fake LLM server exposes four helper endpoints for driver code (not used
by kilo). Every one of them requires `Authorization: Bearer <admin token>`,
where the token is `FAKE_LLM_ADMIN_TOKEN` or, for a zero-config local stack,
the insecure development default `local-fake-llm-admin`:

- `POST /test/release?tag=<tag>` — release a parked `gate:<tag>` turn. 204
  on hit, 404 if no waiter is parked for that tag.
- `GET /test/gate-status?tag=<tag>` — returns `{ tag, engaged }` so the
  driver can poll until a gate is actually holding a stream (i.e. kilo has
  dialed the fake and the turn is blocked).
- `GET /test/waiters` — returns parked gate counts plus live hang/gate streams
  so scenarios can detect leaked fake-server waiters after a terminal turn.
- `GET /test/requests` — returns chat completion request counts so model
  preflight scenarios can prove that rejected models did not reach dispatch.
  `?scope=<token>` returns that scope's count instead of the global total (400
  for a malformed token); the token is the `__e2e_scope__:<token>` marker a
  prompt carried.

These are wrapped by `releaseGate()`, `waitForGateEngaged()`,
`fetchFakeWaiters()`, and `fetchFakeRequests()` in `client.ts`, which attach the
bearer from `fakeControlHeaders()` in the same module. The token comes from
`resolveFakeAdminToken()` in `fake-llm-admin.ts` — the same resolver the local
Node server uses — so a non-default `FAKE_LLM_ADMIN_TOKEN` reaches both ends
without further configuration. Set it when the fake is reachable beyond
localhost: the fake binds `0.0.0.0`, and the public tunnel refuses to publish
the development default. The deployed Worker requires the token as a Worker
secret; see `deploy/README.md`.

## Lifecycle scenarios

For the session-continuity contract (long-lived, recoverable chats) and the
reusable catalog of planned and existing scenarios, see
[`SESSION-CONTINUITY.md`](./SESSION-CONTINUITY.md).

| Lifecycle | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cold` | Fresh session; verify a new per-session sandbox appears and the conversation completes. |
| `hot` | Warmup with `echo:warmup`, then send the real prompt on the same session. Same container. |
| `cold-hot` | One cold turn plus `echo:hot`, `slow:3:50`, and `echo:followup` hot turns on the same session/sandbox. |
| `worktree-chat` | Creates a worktree chat through the public tRPC surface; verifies workspace/worktree identity, idempotent same-key replay, a cold echo boot, and one hot echo turn with stable allocation references. |
| `worktree-multi-chat` | Boots a root chat, lazily creates a sibling in the same worktree/sandbox, and proves: shared uncommitted file write→read→overwrite (parsed echo equals an independent writer nonce), sequential question ownership/replay/answer isolation (asked in the root while the sibling is idle), targeted interrupt of the sibling while the root holds a paced turn (root nonterminal then completing, allocation unchanged), and targeted delete of the sibling leaving the root accepting another turn. The runtime serializes streaming model turns, so it does not claim two chats streaming at one instant. |
| `long-conversation` | One cold `echo:cold` turn plus twelve hot turns — nine `echo:<token>`, one paced `slow:2:50`, and a real `file:write`/`file:read` pair whose parsed echo body equals the writer nonce. Every hot turn completes with no re-preparation and a stable allocation reference. |
| `leave-and-return` | Boots, completes a boot echo turn, then leaves the session unattended; requires the allocation to disappear, then a resume turn on a distinct non-null allocation with the boot content replayed from a fresh stream. |
| `large-stream` | Stages a real file and asks the model to read it; requires a correlated completed read whose persisted output meets the byte floor, plus a paced follow-up on the same session. |
| `concurrent-chats` | Boots two independent sessions, holds one paced turn in each with proven overlapping `running`, and requires both to reach a completed terminal (or recover) on their own chat. |
| `interrupt-then-continue` | Interrupts an actively running paced turn, asserts `cloud.message.failed reason=interrupted`, then completes a follow-up on the same session. |
| `question-idle-resume` | Leaves a real `question:<tag>:<text>` unanswered; requires `toolResults.question=0`, the allocation to disappear inside the 15-minute idle window, the parked message to be terminal before the continuation, and a follow-up completing on a distinct non-null allocation (~30-minute budget). |
| `external-kill` | After a completed turn, kills the identity-matched owned container via `sandboxFaults`; requires the same session to complete a follow-up on a distinct allocation reference. |
| `kill-mid-flight` | Kills the identity-matched owned container while a parked `gate:<tag>` turn runs; requires a durable failure and a follow-up on a distinct allocation. Needs `gates` + `sandboxFaults`. |
| `wrapper-freeze-settled-reap` | Freezes only the identity-matched control-wrapper process after a completed turn; requires identity-correlated evidence — the `health_unhealthy_unresponsive` `allocation_transition` into `stopping.destroying`, a terminal `native_stop`, the heartbeat-expiry recovery start, no re-ready wrapper — plus a distinct replacement. |
| `wrapper-freeze-inflight-reap` | Freezes the identity-matched control-wrapper process while a paced turn is held; requires the held message to terminalise `runtime_unhealthy`, an identity-matched `accepted_reconciliation` and still-active route, the settled-reap stop evidence, and a distinct replacement. |
| `control-socket-recycle-boot` | Drops the identity-matched control wrapper's control socket during the first attach (`SIGUSR1`) and requires, from a cursor captured immediately before the signal, `socket_closed` (this attach connection, handshake complete) → `handshake_committed` (a new connection) → `wrapper_ready` (that connection) with the same wrapper identity. The initial turn must complete with the echo intact and exactly one prompt dispatch; a no-op signal fails. |
| `queue-while-busy` | Hold a bounded `slow:60:1000:16` turn, enqueue two echoes, and assert FIFO delivery through `cloud.message.*` events as the hold completes. |
| `queue-rapid-fire-no-gate` | Send immediate follow-ups behind `echo:first` and assert they reach their terminal FIFO state without gate coordination. |
| `queue-overflow` | Fill a cold session's pending queue while its route prepares until enqueue fails with HTTP 429 (`PENDING_QUEUE_FULL`), observe the container, then `interruptSession` and assert the queued messages are cleared. The new plane delivers while `ready`, so the fill targets the preparation window. |
| `queue-interrupt-clears` | Hold a paced turn, enqueue two, `interruptSession`, assert `cloud.message.failed` with `reason: 'interrupted'` for each. |
| `llm-error` | Return fake provider HTTP 402 with an `insufficient_quota` body, then assert a terminal `cloud.message.failed`, `interruptSession` as a no-op on the settled message, and a completed follow-up on the same session. **Fails locally**: the non-BYOK Next.js gateway converts the 402 to retryable HTTP 503, so the wrapper retries instead of settling (observed: 21 `scenario="error"` requests, no terminal within 120s). Pre-existing behavior of the unchanged `fake-llm-core.ts` error handler, not a harness assertion bug. |
| `chunked-streaming` | Stream delayed fake chunks and assert multiple downstream `message.part.delta` events survive. |
| `empty-response` | Run `idle`, assert completion, and assert no downstream `message.part.delta` is emitted. |
| `interrupt-mid-stream` | Interrupt an actively paced fake request and assert the active message is interrupted, not a queued message. |
| `unknown-model` | Use a model rejected by the fake validation route and require synchronous rejection before sandbox creation or fake chat dispatch. |
| `auth-reject` | Probes the deployed fake Worker's public auth boundary (model routes and `/test/*`) with/without valid bearers; declares `deployedHttpAuthBoundary`, so it is unsupported locally. |
| `callback-completion` | Open the profile's callback sink, register `callbackTarget.url`, run `echo:done`, assert the sink received `status: 'completed'`. |
| `callback-batch-followup` | Queue two turns behind a paced callback session, assert one callback for the final queued turn, then assert a later hot turn emits a fresh callback and no extra one after the batch settles. |
| `callback-interrupt` | Paced active turn + `interruptSession`, assert callback fires with `status: 'interrupted'`. |
| `worktree-multi-chat-parallel` | New-plane only (`controlPlaneV2` + `controlPlaneRuntime`). See the new-plane table above: proves two chats stream at the same instant. |
| `control-plane-callbacks` | New-plane only. See the new-plane table above: new-plane callback + persisted `cloud_agent_session_runs` report row. |
| `command` | New-plane only. See the new-plane table above: `/compact` command and a required increase in the Kilo summary count. |
| `attachment` | New-plane only, and `unsupported` until the `attachments` seeding capability exists. See the new-plane table above: attachment content must reach the model prompt. |
| `contained-credentials` | New-plane only. See the new-plane table above: clone + model + checkout read under containment, plus a raw-credential negative check. |
| `kilo-kill-recovery` | New-plane only. See the new-plane table above: `SIGKILL` Kilo after tool progress, require `agent_restarted`, recover in the same container. |
| `wrapper-kill-recovery` | New-plane only. See the new-plane table above: `SIGKILL` the new-plane wrapper, require `agent_restarted` and the old Kilo pid gone, recover in the same container. |
| `kilo-hang-recovery` | New-plane only. See the new-plane table above: `SIGSTOP` Kilo while the fake holds the first token, require a new Kilo pid, the progressed turn failing `agent_restarted`, the original user message once, and a fresh follow-up completing. |

The three callback scenarios are shared definitions. Their `callbacks` capability
is provided by the profile: a host HTTP sink under local Docker, and the e2e
surface sink (`POST /__e2e/callbacks`, `GET`/`DELETE /__e2e/callbacks/:token`)
over HTTP, where the Worker self-fetches the minted URL.

### New-plane (`workspace_*`) scenarios

These scenarios are written against the control-plane V2 (`workspace_*`) sessions
described in `docs/control-plane.md`. C1 (the routing cutover) is not done yet, so
they declare `controlPlaneV2`, which the local profiles advertise only when the
operator sets `E2E_CONTROL_PLANE_V2=1`. Without it they report `unsupported` with
the missing-capability reason. They are listed in the matrix and are
expected-unsupported until then.

The opt-in flag alone is **not** the plane proof: the legacy plane also issues
`workspace_*` ids. Every new-plane scenario also declares `controlPlaneRuntime`,
which is a local-Docker capability. After boot it captures the new-plane control
wrapper (`kilocode-control-plane-wrapper.js`) uniquely in the owned container and
returns its identity; a legacy container has no such process, so `proveNewPlane`
throws and an opted-in run against a still-legacy plane fails loudly instead of
false-passing. `prepareBrowserSession` already sets `createdOnPlatform:
'cloud-agent-web'`, so once C1 lands, the cutover routes these sessions to the
new plane; the scenario does not need a separate create path.

| Lifecycle | What it does |
|---|---|
| `worktree-multi-chat-parallel` | Creates a root worktree chat and a sibling, proves the new plane, then dispatches a bounded `slow:60:1000:16` hold to both chats at once. Requires both turns durably `running` at the same observation, both streams correlated, both completed, and per-chat content isolation. The existing `worktree-multi-chat` cannot prove concurrent streaming. |
| `control-plane-callbacks` | Boots a `workspace_*` session, proves the new plane, registers the callback target through the internal `updateSession` endpoint (the public grouped `start` rejects `callbackTarget`), and requires one warm turn to produce both a terminal callback (`status: completed`) and a persisted `cloud_agent_session_runs` report row with `status: completed`. Needs `callbacks` + `reports`. |
| `command` | Sends a `/compact` command through `sendMessageV2` (the unified `send` accepts prompts and attachments only; after C1 that endpoint resolves the `workspace_*` session to the new plane and the DO stores a command intent). Requires the turn to complete **and** the live Kilo history summary count to increase, so a completed turn without summarization fails. |
| `attachment` | Requires the `attachments` seeding capability (no profile provides R2 write access yet, so the whole scenario is `unsupported` without it) and proves the new plane. Stages an attachment, sends it, and requires its content to appear in the fake LLM's last user prompt — the content must reach the model, not just be read from disk. |
| `contained-credentials` | Requires `credentialContainment`, advertised from the Worker's own `.dev.vars` `CREDENTIAL_CONTAINMENT_ENABLED` (not a second harness flag). Proves the new plane, requires clone + model + a real checkout read to complete, and proves the negative: no raw SCM credential marker in the container environment and no credential in the git remote. The harness cannot observe the credential lookup itself; a failed negative check is the signal that containment did not apply. |
| `kilo-kill-recovery` | Holds a turn with `write-then-gate` (a real write tool call, so the turn made progress), then `SIGKILL`s the captured `kilo serve` process. Requires the held message to fail with `agent_restarted` (not be resubmitted) and a follow-up to complete in the same container. |
| `wrapper-kill-recovery` | Same tool-progress hold, then `SIGKILL`s the captured new-plane control wrapper. Requires `agent_restarted`, proves the old Kilo pid is gone, and requires a follow-up to complete in the same container. |
| `kilo-hang-recovery` | `SIGSTOP`s Kilo while the fake LLM holds the first token (`first-token:<tag>`). Waits for a correlated native assistant delta before freezing. Requires a new Kilo pid, the progressed turn failing `agent_restarted`, and a fresh follow-up completing in the same allocation. The original user message must appear exactly once in Kilo history (text parts == 1). Pre-progress retry remains a separate wrapper regression contract. |

Capabilities: all eight need `controlPlaneV2` + `controlPlaneRuntime`; the three
process faults add `sandboxFaults`; callback/report adds `callbacks` + `reports`
(Postgres `DATABASE_URL`); attachment adds `attachments`; containment adds
`credentialContainment`. `controlPlaneRuntime`, `sandboxFaults`, and `reports` are
local-only, so these scenarios are `unsupported` on the HTTP/deployed profiles.

Honest limits, recorded because C1 and B8 are not done:

- `control-plane-callbacks` also needs a `tryUpdate`/callback-target path on the
  V2 Session DO and routing to it; both are part of the cutover.
- The report check reads the persisted `cloud_agent_session_runs` row (what the
  queue consumer stored), not the worker-log `session_message_committed` line: a
  report the consumer dropped as schema-invalid leaves no row and fails the
  scenario.
- The three process faults assert the wrapper-submission contract. B8 owns that
  work, so they fail with the missing behaviour until B8 and C1 land; until then
  only the fault helpers (`signalKiloServerProcess`, the wrapper matcher, the
  `first-token` directive) are exercised by unit tests.
- The B8 real-Kilo check established that a repeated `prompt_async` with the
  same `messageID` appends a second copy of the text parts. No scenario relies on
  idempotent resubmission; the hang scenario depends on the wrapper's own
  restart-resubmission, not on the harness replaying a message id.


### e2e surface auth (HTTP profiles)

The `/__e2e/*` surface is mounted only on the e2e entrypoint. Every route needs
**both** the e2e-scoped `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`, presented as `x-internal-api-key`
and compared in constant time, and a valid Kilo JWT. The secret gate runs first,
so an absent or wrong secret is rejected before JWT verification and before any
Hyperdrive dereference.

`POST /__e2e/callbacks/:token` is the single exemption from both gates: callback
delivery sends no Kilo credential, so ingest authenticates with its unguessable
path token. Mint (`POST /__e2e/callbacks`), read/delete (`GET`/`DELETE
/__e2e/callbacks/:token`) and any extra or trailing path segment stay behind both
gates.

Security consequence, recorded honestly. Holding the e2e secret with no JWT lets
a caller replace any sandbox's wrapper credential by id
(`POST /internal/sandbox-control/seed` is secret-only and unowned) and disrupt
another user's running sandbox in the e2e Worker's namespace:
`SandboxControl.setWrapperCredentialHash` overwrites the credential hash and
destroys the runtime, readiness and heartbeat state. With a valid JWT plus the
secret, isolation is still partial: session lookups are keyed
`${JWT userId}:${sessionId}`, so user A cannot reach user B's session Durable
Object by naming B's session, and `updateSession` only rewrites callback metadata
inside the selected DO. `cleanupSession` is the exception: it deletes session
resources without the `requireCurrentSessionAccess` check the public
`deleteSession` applies, so the secret plus any valid JWT can trigger cleanup of
an **unowned** session id; seed remains the only no-JWT path.
`E2E_INTERNAL_API_SECRET` must differ from production's value — an operator
requirement the scripts cannot prove.

### API dimension

The harness exercises both tRPC surfaces. Pass `--api=legacy` to drive the
`prepareSession` + `initiateFromKilocodeSessionV2` + `sendMessageV2`
procedures (what the web UI uses today); the default `--api=unified` uses
the newer `start` / `send` procedures. `prepareSession` requires
`INTERNAL_API_SECRET`: the driver reads it from `.dev.vars` for the Docker
profile and from the resolved e2e secret for the deployed and local-HTTP
profiles, and it always POSTs `/trpc/prepareSession`. The e2e surface has no
prepare adapter; scenarios that pin the legacy flow (the callback scenarios)
select it themselves.

## Troubleshooting

- **Known CLI 7.4.20 stall during snapshot initialization** — Local real-model
  multichat runs have stopped receiving native HTTP responses and global event
  heartbeats after snapshot initialization began, while the Kilo process remained
  alive. Captured container memory was about 1 GB with zero OOM events. The wrapper
  correctly reports `feed_stale` and retires the shared runtime as `kilo_unhealthy`,
  which can fail sibling turns. The underlying native cause is not established;
  snapshot activity is a correlation, not a proven cause. This remains a known
  limitation: keep snapshots and health deadlines unchanged, preserve failed-run
  evidence, and distinguish failed cases from downstream checks that were not run.
- **`Must provide either githubRepo or gitUrl`** — The driver defaults to
  a public HTTPS repo. Override with `E2E_GIT_URL=...` if your network
  blocks GitHub or you prefer a different test repo.
- **`NEXTAUTH_SECRET` not set** — Copy `.dev.vars.example` → `.dev.vars`
  and fill in the local secret (same value used by `apps/web`).
- **`POSTGRES_URL not configured`** — Set root `.env.local` `POSTGRES_URL`,
  or export `DATABASE_URL` to override the database URL for this harness.
- **Sandbox calls out to a real provider** — the session model must be
  `kilo/fake-deterministic`, Next.js must have `FAKE_LLM_URL` set (from
  `pnpm dev:env`), and the `fake-llm` service must be running
  (`pnpm dev:status`). Tail the fake's log (`tail -f dev/logs/fake-llm.log`)
  to confirm kilo is hitting it through the gateway.
- **`waitForGateEngaged` timed out** — kilo never reached the fake LLM. Most
  common cause: the session used a real model, `FAKE_LLM_URL` is missing from
  Next.js, or the fake service is not running. Confirm with
  `curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${FAKE_LLM_ADMIN_TOKEN:-local-fake-llm-admin}" $FAKE_LLM_URL/test/requests`
  (expect a rising `chatCompletions` count as kilo dials the fake) and
  `tail -f dev/logs/fake-llm.log` — a
  stream that stays empty while a turn is "preparing" means the wrapper
  never started, not a fake-LLM problem. A 401 here means the token in your
  shell differs from the one the fake was started with.
- **`/test/*` side channels return 401** — the driver and the fake disagree on
  `FAKE_LLM_ADMIN_TOKEN`. Both read `resolveFakeAdminToken()`; restart the fake
  after changing the variable so the running process and the driver match.
- **`Worker "git-token-service-dev" not found` in `cloud-agent-next.log`** —
  the `GIT_TOKEN_SERVICE` service binding could not resolve. The Worker log
  shows the failure as `Failed to issue Kilo session capability` and the turn
  terminates immediately with `cloud.message.failed`. Cause: the
  `cloudflare-git-token-service` dev process is up on its port but stale and
  not heartbeating into the shared dev-registry (check
  `.wrangler/dev-registry/` for a missing `git-token-service-dev` entry). Fix:
  `pnpm dev:restart cloudflare-git-token-service`, then confirm the entry
  reappears. The fake LLM is irrelevant here — kilo never gets far enough to
  dial it.
- **Matrix fails with `preparing×N` and no terminal** — Correlate the failed
  message with Worker and wrapper logs before classifying the cause. Container
  startup failures happen before wrapper bootstrap; a `post-bootstrap kilo
  session lookup begin` without an end identifies a later native lookup stall.
  Matrix cleanup interrupts its tracked sessions before stopping exclusively
  owned sandboxes. For older runs or an interrupted driver, cancel only the
  recorded run-owned sessions before any owned-family teardown: killing a
  container alone leaves queued work able to recreate it after a Worker restart.
  Preserve the failed result and rerun the scenario in isolation; a successful
  retry does not erase the original failure.
- **`releaseGate` returned 404** — the gate already went away, usually
  because the wrapper's request was aborted (e.g. by an `interruptSession`).
  Queue-interrupt-clears tolerates this; other scenarios treat it as an
  error.
